*The keyboard for fat fingers.*

The name “Wurstfinger” is a nod to the “fat finger” problem—thumb-heavy typing on small screens.

Wurstfinger is a MessagEase-inspired keyboard for iOS written in SwiftUI. It
brings thumb-friendly gestures from Thumb-Key and the original MessagEase
layout to Apple devices, including circular gestures for uppercase letters,
return swipes for typographic punctuation, and compose rules to generate
accented characters.

## Why Wurstfinger?

Traditional QWERTY keyboards waste screen space and require precise tapping. Wurstfinger uses a 3×3 grid with swipe gestures, so your thumbs travel less and hit the right key more often—even on small screens. Once you get past the learning curve (a few days of practice), you'll type faster and with fewer errors.

- **Thumb-Key's gesture engine**: swipes, swipe-and-return (other case or a variant), circles (clockwise: other case, counter-clockwise: number), long press, and optional slide and slide-and-hold on space and backspace
- **Thumb-Key's utility keys**: space bar multi-tap punctuation and cursor swipes, word deletion on backspace, the emoji key (settings, hide letters, language, move keyboard, switch keyboard, hide keyboard) and the text-edit swipes on 123 (copy, cut, paste, select all, undo, redo)
- **Compose engine** that reproduces Thumb-Key's combination triggers (e.g. `' + a → á`)
- **Emoji picker** with every Emoji 15.0 character and recently used emoji, and a **clipboard history** with pinning and a private clipboard
- **Look and feel**: Thumb-Key's color themes, key padding, border and radius, hidden letters or symbols, split keyboard and press animation
- **Modify keys**: change any key with the same YAML format as Thumb-Key
- **Customizable settings**: haptic feedback intensity, keyboard scale and key aspect ratio, backup and restore
- **Onboarding flow** with interactive setup guide

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 16 (or newer)
- iOS 17 SDK

### Building

Open the project in Xcode:

```bash
xed wurstfinger/wurstfinger.xcodeproj
```

or build from the command line on macOS:

```bash
cd wurstfinger/wurstfinger
xcodebuild -scheme Wurstfinger -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' build
```

### Running Tests

The project includes unit tests for gesture handling and compose logic. Run
all tests with:

```bash
cd wurstfinger/wurstfinger
xcodebuild test -scheme Wurstfinger -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16' -only-testing:WurstfingerTests
```

> **Note:** Some tests require an available iOS Simulator. Adjust the
> destination to match your local simulator name if necessary.

### Installing the Keyboard

1. Build and run the `Wurstfinger` scheme on a device or simulator.
2. The app includes an interactive onboarding guide that walks you through:
   - Adding the keyboard in **Settings › General › Keyboard › Keyboards**
   - Enabling "Allow Full Access" for cursor control and deletion features
   - Testing the keyboard in the practice view
