# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why is there a bar below the keyboard with globe and microphone buttons?

The bar at the bottom of the keyboard is a system-controlled area that iOS displays below all third-party keyboard extensions. It sits within the device's **Safe Area** and contains the globe button (to switch keyboards) and the microphone button (for dictation).

This area is managed entirely by iOS — keyboard extensions are placed *above* it and cannot remove, resize, or draw into this space. Third-party keyboards can only draw within the primary view of their `UIInputViewController`.

On jailbroken devices, the optional WurstSecure companion tweak can remove
UIKit's bottom keyboard padding for Wurstfinger. The home gesture remains
active, so the bottom row intentionally sits inside its gesture region.

## Why can't I select text with the keyboard?

**Text selection is controlled by the app**, not the keyboard. Keyboard extensions cannot programmatically select text — they can only move the cursor and read nearby text. To select text, use the standard iOS gestures (long-press, double-tap) directly in the text field.

Wurstfinger supports **Copy, Cut, and Paste** via swipe gestures on the symbols toggle key (123/ABC): swipe up to copy, up-right to cut, and down to paste. Full Access must be enabled.
